The word Gelly is from a Gaelic word; \u2018Gheallaidh\u2019 which loosely translated means \u2018Shining Waters\u2019 or \u2018Loch of Brightness\u2019, hence the name \u2018Loch of Shining Waters\u2019 for our group. We chose this name to mark the significance of our local Loch and the towns namesake.\r\n\r\nThe site was created by two volunteers from the Lochgelly area, who have spent many hours researching, networking and engaging with many local individuals, groups, and the local authority to help further develop this resource site for the benefit of the local community.\r\n\r\nThe site has grown in popularity and content since 2010, and we have received much help from the local community through feedback, support and contributions, which has led to many awards for the work that we all do collectively.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th November 2012, the group has formalised the organisation by signing a constitution and selecting a board of members. Currently we are a constituted voluntary group, but aim to develop the project into a Social Enterprise or Registered Charity so we can better serve the local community.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have opted for a constitution, is so that we can further develop the project to develop local projects and initiatives through community engagement, to provide additional community resources directly in the Lochgelly area, and expand our community services beyond an online role.","lat":56.1261317092295,"platform":"Wordpress"}},{"hyperlocal_site":{"created_at":"2012-07-18T11:36:38+01:00","title":"Lochwinnoch Online","country":"Scotland","updated_at":"2012-07-18T18:00:40+01:00","party_affiliation":"","feed_url":"http://www.lochwinnoch.info/feed","distance_covered":3.0,"url":"http://www.lochwinnoch.info/","lng":-4.24072,"id":1105,"metres":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[259842.365938751,664893.83226092]},"area_covered":"lochwinnoch","hyperlocal_group_id":null,"council_id":358,"description":"What's happening in Lochwinnoch","lat":55.8568,"platform":""}},{"hyperlocal_site":{"created_at":"2010-02-08T11:44:00+00:00","title":"Locks Heath People","country":"England","updated_at":"2010-02-16T12:24:59+00:00","party_affiliation":"","feed_url":"http://www.locksheathpeople.co.uk/news/rss.html?chid=181558","distance_covered":3.0,"url":"http://www.locksheathpeople.co.uk","lng":-1.27785,"id":196,"metres":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[450922.796744983,106980.458371087]},"area_covered":"Locks Heath","hyperlocal_group_id":6,"council_id":268,"description":"Locksheathpeople is a local community site for Locks Heath in Hampshire.

Our website is updated regularly with news, culture, opinion and features on events in the Greater Manchester region.\r\n\r\nThe Thinking behind MULE\r\n\r\nThree core principles underlie our work:\r\n\r\n1) Providing an alternative has never been more important. Traditional local media is facing hard times. Budget cuts and the turn away from serious reporting means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an information vacuum waiting to be filled in our communities. On a wider level, the commercial media system is dominated by a small number of huge corporations and wealthy individuals. This system promotes commercial values, and filters out information not conducive to the immediate bottom line or long-run corporate interests. MULE aims to cover the burning issues that the mainstream media neglect, without screaming down peoples necks, being boring or preachy, or speaking to a select, in-the-know audience.\r\n\r\n2) Media as a tool for social change. At its best independent media supports progressive social movements by raising public awareness and providing information that is a tool in the hands of campaigners. This starts at home. The place we can be most effective is in our backyard, holding power to account in Manchester.\r\n\r\n3) Openness and inclusivity. From the start, MULE has been an organisation run primarily by volunteers. We want to provide an opportunity for writers, designers, web geeks and volunteers of all varieties, to get involved and share or improve their skills.","lat":53.4782,"platform":"Wordpress"}},{"hyperlocal_site":{"created_at":"2010-12-16T16:02:23+00:00","title":"Manx Voice","country":"England","updated_at":"2012-03-19T15:32:46+00:00","party_affiliation":"","feed_url":"http://manxvoice.com/feed/","distance_covered":20.0,"url":"http://manxvoice.com/","lng":-4.49341,"id":734,"metres":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[237285.092073383,476405.055508174]},"area_covered":"Isle of Man","hyperlocal_group_id":null,"council_id":null,"description":"A hyperlocal site for the Isle of Man.

It will be the virtual shadow of the new East London Line, connecting communities in virtual space, just as the new line connects them in physical space. For the first time the residents of Croydon can easily access the bars of Shoreditch, and a single Mum in Hackney can reasonably contemplate a job in Crystal Palace. Goldsmiths college lies in the centre of the line and students on our world-class journalism courses will be keeping you informed about your newly connected world. Their work will be guided by experienced journalists, and it is our hope that EastLondonLines will in time, provide not only a place to learn, but a place to earn, for young journalists entering a profession currently beset by problems. We promise to bring you real news, produced to the highest ethical standards, but we will also tell you about the people and the pleasures to be found along the line.",

Narrowing it down a bit, we mostly cover the bits of Finchley to the North of the A406 (North Circular) mainly because there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a busy community site serving East Finchley already, alongside a commercial one.\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re here to encourage positive local community projects that involve voluntary co-operation. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re expressly not a local political website and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take sides \u00e2\u20ac\u201c we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll cover or link to anything that we think is of interest.\r\n\r\nWe want to set up some LinkedIn groups to promote local business networking (any volunteers for this?). There is already a Facebook group for Finchley Village, and we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve got one for North Finchley and Woodside Park as well. And we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re on twitter at @finchlinks\r\n\r\nWe will be concentrating on the bits of Finchley north of the A406 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c North, West and Central Finchley. There is already a lively community site for East Finchley \u00e2\u20ac\u201c here. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s also a wider community site for the whole of The London Borough of Barnet.\r\n\r\nThis site is here to help develop a community of people in the area who are talking to each other a bit more. We want to use it to promote good innovative ideas and to help people who want to do interesting things in the area to meet up with each other. An early post on the site have covered a lot of this in more detail.\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d like to start informal business meetups and get people together for arts / culture / history / educational projects. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re looking for people with positive ideas (and when we set the site up, we had a few of our own \u00e2\u20ac\u201c stay tuned) to get a discussion going.\r\n\r\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re not a political project and we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t want to nail our colours to any particular approach to local regeneration. Instead, we want to help you to get together with others to describe the challenges that you think the area faces. We\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re asking commenters to be as positive as they can.",

The other pool is used by people of all ages, backgrounds, capabilities and needs. Until 2004 Moseley Road Baths operated the only public washing baths in the city.\r\n\r\nAlthough not presently operating at full capacity, many people from the surrounding area as well as nationally, recognise the importance of Moseley Road Baths, this Grade II* listed building, and have campaigned over a number of years to keep this beautiful yet pragmatic building open for a wide range of people to use and enjoy.\r\n\r\nAs it struggles to meet the demand for swimming and to accommodate the needs of people with a whole range of swimming needs it is clear how essential it is to invest in this national treasure.",

It is hoped that the full involvement of local people in the process will not only provide the best opportunity for long term sustainability of the project but will also help with the wider social and economic regeneration of the area, providing people with skills and confidence to start new projects, access training or further education or find employment either within the project or elsewhere.\r\n",

The word Gelly is from a Gaelic word; \u2018Gheallaidh\u2019 which loosely translated means \u2018Shining Waters\u2019 or \u2018Loch of Brightness\u2019, hence the name \u2018Loch of Shining Waters\u2019 for our group. We chose this name to mark the significance of our local Loch and the towns namesake.\r\n\r\nThe site was created by two volunteers from the Lochgelly area, who have spent many hours researching, networking and engaging with many local individuals, groups, and the local authority to help further develop this resource site for the benefit of the local community.\r\n\r\nThe site has grown in popularity and content since 2010, and we have received much help from the local community through feedback, support and contributions, which has led to many awards for the work that we all do collectively.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th November 2012, the group has formalised the organisation by signing a constitution and selecting a board of members. Currently we are a constituted voluntary group, but aim to develop the project into a Social Enterprise or Registered Charity so we can better serve the local community.\r\n\r\nThe reason we have opted for a constitution, is so that we can further develop the project to develop local projects and initiatives through community engagement, to provide additional community resources directly in the Lochgelly area, and expand our community services beyond an online role.",

Our website is updated regularly with news, culture, opinion and features on events in the Greater Manchester region.\r\n\r\nThe Thinking behind MULE\r\n\r\nThree core principles underlie our work:\r\n\r\n1) Providing an alternative has never been more important. Traditional local media is facing hard times. Budget cuts and the turn away from serious reporting means there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s an information vacuum waiting to be filled in our communities. On a wider level, the commercial media system is dominated by a small number of huge corporations and wealthy individuals. This system promotes commercial values, and filters out information not conducive to the immediate bottom line or long-run corporate interests. MULE aims to cover the burning issues that the mainstream media neglect, without screaming down peoples necks, being boring or preachy, or speaking to a select, in-the-know audience.\r\n\r\n2) Media as a tool for social change. At its best independent media supports progressive social movements by raising public awareness and providing information that is a tool in the hands of campaigners. This starts at home. The place we can be most effective is in our backyard, holding power to account in Manchester.\r\n\r\n3) Openness and inclusivity. From the start, MULE has been an organisation run primarily by volunteers. We want to provide an opportunity for writers, designers, web geeks and volunteers of all varieties, to get involved and share or improve their skills.",

We\u2019ll also have some local history and nice pictures for good measure.\r\n\r\nIf you\u2019ve got something you\u2019d like to see on the site just get in touch and we\u2019ll do our best to feature it.\r\n\r\nWe\u2019re also closely linked with the Roath Cardiff twitter feed, which pumps out a vast amount of information about the local area and what people are up to. We suggest following it for updates.\r\n\r\nWho is behind the site?\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a team of three of us. We do it because we\u2019re interested in the local area. We are Matt Appleby, Geraldine Nichols and Huw Thomas. We have to give a big thank you to Ed Walker (formerly of yourcardiff) who was on the original team before moving up to London.\r\n\r\nWhen did it start?\r\n\r\nIt started in June 2011 after a chat in the Albany pub.\r\n\r\nCan I get something featured?\r\n\r\nSure, just drop us a line. We\u2019re all ears to anything Roath related.",

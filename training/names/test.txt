Warning: Labour sounded fears over the Tories' Housing Bill as protesters march through Westminster

Councils could be forced to flog libraries and parks to plug a black hole in the Tories' social housing sell-off, Labour has warned.

Shadow Housing Minister John Healey sounded the alert today as protesters staged a march through Westminster against the Housing Bill.

Campaigners fear the law will destroy social housing by extending Right to Buy to housing associations, ending lifetime council tenancies and classing £450,000 Starter Homes as 'affordable housing'.

Now it could have another consequence as town halls grapple with fresh cuts in Wednesday's Budget.

Cash to fund the Right to Buy extensions is meant to come from selling off high-value council homes - a policy branded "extremely questionable" by MPs on the communities and local government committee.

But reports by Shelter and the Chartered Institute of Housing have warned sales will fall more than £2billion short of what Tory ministers predicted.

The government is already selling £4.5billion of land to balance the books - and Mr Healey told the Mirror councils could be forced to follow suit.

He added: "George Osborne’s sums simply just don’t stack up, and his flagship right-to-buy plans are now mired in confusion and incompetence. Ministers have promised a policy they can’t deliver.

"Whatever happens, the Chancellor’s forced sale of council homes to pay for this right-to-buy extension is set to lead to an irreversible loss of genuinely affordable homes at a time when they have never been needed more.

"He should listen to Labour and drop his damaging plans."

Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell joined the Kill The Housing Bill protest as activists brandished banners declaring: "Housing is a human right".

But Jeremy Corbyn was forced to miss the march due to an injury, MP Diane Abbott told the crowd.

A spokesman for the Labour leader told the Mirror: "He had a very minor leg muscle strain on Thursday.

"Since then he's been up to Newcastle and Sheffield to do campaigning. He's okay."

A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: "The government is determined to help anyone who aspires to own their own home - social housing tenants have the same aspirations as everyone else.

"Over the next four years, councils will have £200 billion to spend on local services like parks and libraries."

The row comes ahead of a revolt over the Tories' Housing Bill as it passes through the House of Lords.

An amendment tomorrow will try and retain council tenancies if ending them hurts 'community cohesion' by shunting children from school to school.

Peers are also trying to stop genuinely affordable homes being replaced with Starter Homes, which cost up to £250,000 or £450,000 in London.

One amendment would let councils block the homes if local average earners cannot afford them.

Another would extend the five-year discount on Starter Homes to stop buy-to-let landlords cashing in.

Tory ministers have already quietly relaxed rules which stop Starter Homes being bought by anyone over 40.

A government spokesman insisted the change only applied to people whose partners were over 40 - but it's feared the system could be left open to exploitation in the future.

Labour peer Lord Bassam told the Mirror: "Short term tenancies will breed long term problems with tenants having little connection or commitment to where they live.

"Instead of recycling the same homes again and again on short lets, the government should focus on building new housing for low rents."

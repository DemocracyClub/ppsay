PROBE URGED OVER 'QUEEN BACKS BREXIT' LEAK

Britain's top mandarin is being urged to investigate who leaked a story claiming that the Queen expressed Eurosceptic views during a private lunch - with Justice Secretary Michael Gove seen as a prime suspect.

Sources told a national newspaper the monarch vented her anger with Brussels at pro-EU former deputy prime minister Nick Clegg during a Privy Council event at Windsor Castle in 2011.

Buckingham Palace has lodged an official complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) and Mr Clegg has branded the claims "untrue". But the newspaper says it stands by the front page story, headlined "Queen Backs Brexit".

COMPETITION WATCHDOG 'TO SET CAP FOR LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLD ENERGY COSTS'

Millions of vulnerable households could see their gas and electricity bills slashed under plans expected to be unveiled in a long-awaited report into Britain's energy sector.

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) will publish its "provisional decision on remedies" after a two-year investigation amid reports that it is likely to set a price cap for low income and vulnerable customers who have pre-payment meters - around 16% of households.

But it is set to scrap plans first mooted last July to set a maximum price limit for standard variable rate tariffs, which would have seen prices cut or frozen for around 70% of customers with the Big Six providers.

The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will meet a mental health campaigner and the man who saved him from taking his own life as they champion efforts to prevent suicide.

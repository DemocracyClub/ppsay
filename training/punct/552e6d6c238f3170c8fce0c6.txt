<s>Saturday will see parliamentary candidates from Yorkshire First take to the streets in towns around the East Riding including Beverley.</s>

<s>Yorkshire First candidates will be joined by supporters of the party who aim to meet with potential voters in Cottingham, Beverley and Driffield.</s>

<s>Founded in April last year, the party wants a stronger voice for Yorkshire with similar powers to Scotland.</s>

<s>In a statement released a spokesperson for Yorkshire first said;</s>

<s><q>"<s>The party's aim is for a Yorkshire parliament with significant devolved powers but not independence</s>"</q>.</s>

<s><q>"<s>Yorkshire First will fight 14 parliamentary seats across Yorkshire as well as around a further 20 seats for local councils</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>They are scheduled to make their first appearance in Beverley at Cross Street between 11.30-12.30</s>

<s>Yorkshire First candidates in the East Riding are Lee Walton, Beverley & Holderness, Stewart Arnold, East Yorkshire and Diana Wallis who is standing in Haltemprice & Howden.</s>

<s>Yorkshire First emergence is yet another example of how the political landscape is starting to change in the UK.</s>

<s>Across the country small groups are beginning to form as more people become disillusioned and feel there is no difference between the so called big parties.</s>

<s>Leader of Yorkshire First, Richard Carter, said:</s>

<s><q>"<s>For too long there has been no effective choice for people in great swathes of Yorkshire and Beverley and Holderness is no different.</s> <s>We want people to have that choice and have a chance to influence the outcome of the most unpredictable election in decades</s>"</q>.</s>

<s><q>"<s>We support decisions being made based, not on whether they are left or right wing, but on how they affect Yorkshire, its people, environment and economy</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Mr. Walton who is targeting Graham Stuarts seat in the May elections said;</s>

<s><q>"<s>There is no reason why Yorkshire should not have first rate devolution like the Scots.</s> <s>After all Yorkshire has a slightly bigger population than them, but no unified voice.</s> <s>Too many decisions in this country are taken in Whitehall.</s> <s>That has to change</s>"</q>.</s>

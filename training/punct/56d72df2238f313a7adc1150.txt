<s>GRASSROOTS activists in Bradford who want Britain to leave the European Union will officially start their campaign with a city-centre leafleting drive on Saturday.</s>

<s>The campaigners will meet in City Park to man stalls and hand out thousands of fliers to passers-by.</s>

<s>They form the Bradford arm of the national cross-party Grassroots Out movement, which aims to unite the various Brexit campaigners in local areas to get them working together on the ground.</s>

<s>Jason Smith, who leads the Grassroots Out campaign in Bradford, said the event would form part of a nationwide day of action by 'leave' campaigners.</s>

<s>He said: <q>"<s>We are going to have lots of tables and we have got 10,000 to 20,000 leaflets so we will be blitzing the city centre with leaflets, talking to local people and explaining what the leave campaign is and what leaving would look like</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Mr Smith, who is also UKIP's Bradford chairman, said he had been joined by Conservative and Green party members locally, while the national campaign also involved former Bradford MP and Respect leader George Galloway as well as Labour figures and trade unions.</s>

<s>He said: <q>"<s>We never expected to be on the same platform as people like George Galloway and left-wing trade unions, so it's quite an unusual collaboration really, but I think it's the only way to reach out to all members and all people.</s>

"<s>Obviously, the Labour Leave policy on leaving the EU might be different to UKIP's policy.</s> <s>Their arguments are slightly different, so that's interesting.</s> <s>I've found it personally quite interesting.</s>

"<s>UKIP's argument is about sovereignty, democracy and immigration, they are the big ones.</s> <s>For Labour Leave and the trade unions, they are wanting to leave because of workers' rights</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Shipley MP Philip Davies, a staunch Eurosceptic who is also campaigning to leave the EU, has already helped start a similar Grassroots Out campaign in Shipley last month.</s>

<s>But the Conservative backbencher said yesterday that he was now keen to take part in public debates with those wanting Britain to stay in the EU.</s>

<s>He said: <q>"<s>What I'm trying to do now is fix up some debates.</s>

"<s>I'm not a big fan of these one-sided rallies.</s> <s>I want to have public debates about the issue</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>All the other MPs in the district - Tory MP for Keighley Kris Hopkins and Bradford's three Labour MPs, Naz Shah, Imran Hussain and Judith Cummins - are supporting the campaign to remain in the EU.</s>

<s>Yesterday, the Government stepped up its warnings over the dangers of leaving the EU, with a fresh analysis by officials concluding that any of the alternative arrangements for relations with Europe would leave Britain worse off.</s>

<s>The paper - which looks at arrangements adopted by countries including Norway, Switzerland and Canada as well as the option of falling back on World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules - warns that none is as good as the deal on offer with Brussels.</s>

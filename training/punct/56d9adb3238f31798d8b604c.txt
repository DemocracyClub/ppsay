<s>In about three months' time the politicians of our green and pleasant land are going to get a horrible shock.</s>

<s>It will become clear that the EU, that thing they all seem to care so very much about, makes not one jot of difference to the other 64million of us.</s>

<s>And it's not because we're stupid, or uninterested - it will be because of the raging hypocrisy on all sides that simply makes us hate them all equally.</s>

<s>It begins, as problems so often do, with Iain Duncan Smith.</s>

<s>Andy Stenning/Daily Mirror Him again</s>

<s>Today he has written an article saying the Remain campaign has been using <q>"<s>spin, smears and threats</s>"</q> to <q>"<s>bully</s>"</q> opponents.</s>

<s>He says the Civil Service has issued <q>"<s>highly questionable dossiers</s>"</q> and added:</s>

<s><q>"<s>Such desperate and unsubstantiated claims are now being made that they begin to damage the very integrity of those who make them in the eyes of the public</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>This is Iain Duncan Smith.</s>

<s>Getty The bogeyman</s>

<s>A man whose department refused for two years to reveal how many people died while their benefits were sanctioned and did so only after ordered to by the Information Commissioner.</s>

<s>A man whose department admitted inventing quotes from fake benefits claimants.</s>

<s>A man who has personally misused a charity report from 2010 to support cutting £30 a week from cancer victims in 2016.</s>

<s>In the light of this evidence he's probably the best-placed person to know what spin, smears, threats, bullying and a total lack of integrity looks like - but does he imagine we haven't noticed his hypocrisy?</s>

<s>Getty Images We won't mention how he sponges off his in-laws who gave him a free house</s>

<s>Yesterday BMW sent a letter to staff pointing out that as a pan-European company it found the EU very useful and a vote for Brexit could cause problems.</s>

<s>The airwaves were instantly filled with Brexiter MPs saying words to the effect of <q>"<s>well, Fritz would say that, wouldn't he?</s>"</q></s>

<s>Yet had the company behind Rolls-Royce said we should LEAVE the EU, those same MPS would have welcomed the intervention and filled the airwaves with glee.</s>

<s>Getty Spitfire.</s> <s>Rolls-Royce.</s> <s>Germany.</s> <s>All very confusing</s>

<s>In the past week or so the Outies have criticised the Civil Service for dossiers which show immigration and the economy are both better inside the EU.</s>

<s>They've talked about disgraceful partiality and the outrage of not being allowed to use these public servants to back up their own campaign.</s>

<s>Yet these are the same people who rely on Civil Service dossiers day in, day out, to substantiate every other government policy they DO agree with.</s> <s>You can't say one dossier is crap and the other 87 are bang-on.</s>

<s>Finally, we've got Project Fear - the nickname given to the Remain campaign by its opponents, over claims Brexit will have unknown consequences.</s>

<s>Getty Image SCREEEEEEEAAAAAAAM</s>

<s>Never mind the fact it does have unknown consequences simply because we haven't done it before, but this is EXACTLY the same tactic used in the Scottish independence referendum less than 16 months ago.</s>

<s>Then Project Fear was welcomed and in fact parroted by precisely the same politicians now decrying it.</s>

<s>Liam Fox said in 2014 the Scottish independence campaign <q>"<s>has almost given licence to those who are pretty xenophobic</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Fast forward a year and he now says Britain must leave the EU <q>"<s>and become an independent, sovereign nation</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>And let's skip over the fact this man was forced to leave office because he kept taking his best mate to highly-sensitive defence meetings.</s>

<s>Because a disgraced politician is SO worth listening to</s>

<s>In 2014, UKIP leader Nigel Farage called on the Queen to intervene in the Scottish referendum.</s>

<s>This year, he decried an apparently pro-EU speech by her grandson because <q>"<s>Prince William has been used by… the pro-EU establishment</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Rex Idiot</s>

<s>And that's just the anti-camp.</s> <s>The other lot are just as bad.</s>

<s>In 2011 David Cameron said EU migration wasn't important and <q>"<s>it's the numbers from outside the EU that really matter</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>In 2013 he said EU and non-EU migrant numbers were <q>"<s>broadly in balance</s>"</q>, in 2015 he called migrants a <q>"<s>swarm</s>"</q> and this year he said benefits <q>"<s>act as a magnet</s>"</q> and EU migration was <q>"<s>still too high</s>"</q>.</s>

<s>Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who voted to leave the EU in 1975, said in September last year he'd unequivocally back staying in.</s>

<s>Getty A man of principle and a new kind of politics</s>

<s>In the same week he told MPs he might leave if workers' rights were reduced AND that a future Labour government would overturn any referendum anyway.</s>

<s>On Monday he ruled out campaigning alongside Cameron despite the fact they're, er, on the same side.</s>

<s>And while Cameron has argued publicly, and loudly, about the referendum Mr Corbyn's few speeches have been as electrifying as a damp sponge.</s>

<s>The 7th Lord Lucan has been more conspicuous.</s>

<s>PA Lord Lucan, who makes more headlines than the Labour leader</s>

<s>While this sorry lot of humbuggering con-artists blether fruitlessly, u-turn like a learner driver stuck on a roundabout and tear their own parties apart, the rest of the nation just despairs.</s>

<s>We despair of having a clear choice one way or the other.</s>

<s>We despair of having national leaders who can be consistent even in their venality.</s>

<s>We despair of being asked to pick a side when both seem equally deceitful, duplicitous and downright dishonest.</s>

<s>Getty Pick a dick</s>

<s>Which is why, when these politicians RUN to the ballot box in June for their moment in history, they'll find they're the only ones there.</s>

<s>It IS worth arguing about.</s> <s>It IS worth voting for.</s>

<s>But the greatest theft in all of this is not about benefits, trade tariffs or farm subsidies.</s>

<s>It's the way these phony, glib, fraudulent, self-appointed Pharisees have stolen away not just our interest and our faith, but are making such an abortion of democracy that we'd be better off handing them to Kim Jong-un for inventive summary execution.</s>
